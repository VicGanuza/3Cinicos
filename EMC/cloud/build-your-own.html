								<h3>IT organizations are competing for customers with "Shadow IT"</h3>
								<p>End users and LOBs are circumventing corporate IT in favor of public cloud offerings that are not available internally. This approach adds risk, cost, and complexity to the management of each application. Adherence to corporate standards for protection, security, and availability are compromised.</p>

								<span class="second"></span>
								<h3>Increasing efficiency to match public cloud providers</h3>
								<p>While many organizations have achieved a high level of virtualization, they are not using their resources efficiently and are over-provisioning their infrastructure and virtual servers. They recognize that there is significant waste, but are unable to narrow the gap.</p>
								<p><strong>EMC & VMware provide automated lifecycle management, real-time analytics, and historical reporting; designed to make the most out of the customers CAPEX and OPEX investments.</strong></p>
							</li>
							<li class="last">
								<span class="third"></span>
								<h3>IT needs to be able to demonstrate value to the business</h3>
								<p>IT organizations are seen as a cost-center by the business and are looking for ways to better determine project and investment priorities as they manage their data centers to narrowing budget resources. They are searching for new methods to connect resource consumers with OPEX and CAPEX costs.</p>
								<p class="last"><strong>EMC’s Hybrid Cloud solution provides increased visibility into the true costs of IT services and can map resource consumption to the application and infrastructure owners.</strong></p>

										<h4>EMC's Response</h4>
                              <p>EMC and VMware offer a broad portfolio of on-prem and hybrid cloud solutions that enable customers to build services and SLAs that are appropriate for their users, rather than adhering to broad public cloud standards. Risk associated with security and compliance is decreased when the data is kept internal. Workloads in public clouds are often "trapped" there due to expensive data migration fees.</p>

Crucial components such as backup, offsite replication and recovery, and security need to be provided by other vendors.

Its backup and offsite replication features are more advanced than Nutanix, but customers still need to provide backup hardware and security from other vendors.

										<p>Automation and Orchestration capabilities exposed through a self-service portal are the centerpiece of the EMC Hybrid Cloud solution. Through the use of a service catalog, cloud consumers are able to experience an "App-Store" like experience in selecting services to consume from the cloud. Cloud administrators are able to build sets of services based on business requirements that align with corporate policies for security, compliance, and availability.</p>

									<div class="accordion-title">"I have VMware already and I can deploy virtual machines from templates, that's my cloud.  If I'm already highly virtualized, why do I need IaaS?"</div>
									<div class="accordion-content">
										<p>Having a highly virtualized data center is a great foundation, but IaaS adds elements of multi-tenancy, self-service, metering/chargeback, analytics, automation and orchestration; enabling the value and benefits of virtualization to extend to the business, beyond the walls of IT. Experiencing agility while maintaining governance, control, and compliance over application workloads enables a much faster time-to-value for new application resources and adds value directly to the business.</p>

									<div class="accordion-title">"Why do I need EMC when VMware already works with all of the other storage that I have?  We have lots of vendors to choose from."</div>
									<div class="accordion-content">
										<p>EMC offers the best integration with VMware, as has been reported by Wikibon for several years running. That level of integration continues into our IaaS offerings as we develop additional support for VMware's automation and orchestration products.</p>
										<p>In addition to our storage arrays, EMC completes the IaaS story by also offering the best backup, replication, security, and management tools that align to meet the requirements of your business users.</p>

								<li class="closed">
									<div class="accordion-title">"I like the idea of IaaS, and it sounds great.  But this seems too complicated for our organization to consume."</div>
									<div class="accordion-content">
										<p>EMC can help you build a roadmap to "cloud" based on YOUR priorities. In most customers, IaaS is the easiest form of "cloud" to consume, and also aligns best with their current highly virtualized environments. Our Services teams and IaaS reference architectures can help to remove both risk and complexity.</p>
										<p>Not everything needs to be done at once; a gradual introduction of IaaS to your users will offer your organization some quick wins and offset the higher costs of eventually playing "catch up".</p>
